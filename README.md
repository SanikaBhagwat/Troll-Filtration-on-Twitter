# Troll-Filtration-on-Twitter
As we know that Twitter is the fastest medium to get news but along with news we also get trolls and irrelevant information. This project focuses on filtering the noise that is the trolls and irrelevant tweets by using various softwares and datasets.

Methodology 


•	Firstly the model is trained on Sarcasm and troll dataset provided by google.

•	After training the model weights are saved and then it is loaded.


•	Then its used to predict whether a tweet is a troll or not. 

•	For training we used models like SVM (Support Vector Machines), Logistic Regression for converting the tweets into something that the machine can understand. We use N-gram vectorizer and TFIDF.


•	Four different types of models were used to detect a troll tweet namely Insult, Threat, Obscene and Toxic.

•	For the frontend Django, HTML, CSS and bootstrap was used.


•	A RIA (Rich Internet Application) webpage was created using the above technologies, where the user had an option to search and get tweets by hashtags or by user handle methods.
